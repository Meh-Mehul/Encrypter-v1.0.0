# Encrypter-v1.0.0
Simple encrypter and decrypter in python using tkinter and basic string manipulation.


For tkinter refrences : https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html

Short explaination of logic behind the code:
The given code first converts eachalphabet to its corresponding numeric form, using a pre defined dictionary then the number is processed for each alphabet in word and finally converted back to another random alphabet


What more can be done:
One may create many dictionaries of specific keys in random order so that each word is initialized randomly but still the encryption order is maintained with respect to each other.
